JS - WAS DESIGNED TO WORK IN THE BROWSER CREATING INTERACTIVE UIs AND REACTIVITY
NODE JS - RUNS ON CHROME'S V8 ENGINE - RUNS ON A SERVER OUTSIDE THE BROWSER

SERVER SIDE LANGUAGE - PYTHON, C++ , JAVA , GO , C , NODE JS
CLIENT SIDE LANGUAGE - HTML, CSS , JS


UI -> SERVER -> DB

SERVER - LOGIC - DATA PROCESSING -> CORRECT DATA TYPES
                        ->  DATA ORG.
                        ->

PSYCOPG2 -POSTGRESQL DATABASE ADAPTER -> CONNECT OUR PYTHON SERVER TO A DB ENVIRONMENT
CLIENT - SERVER MODEL 
CLIENT - USUALLY A BROWSER THAT SENDS A REQUEST FOR DATA OR WEB PAGES
SERVER - COMPUTER THAT RECEIVES REQUESTS FROM A CLIENT, PROCESSES IT AND SENDS A RESPONSE

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TYPE A URL?
www.netflix.com
1.dns lookup - translating domain names to IP addresses
2.client sends a request
3.server receives request
4.response

ip address - unique number assigned to each device on a network e.g 192.168.1.1

html/css/js ---------- python ------------ sql

database.py -> db file -> execute db operations
main.py -> flask -> server file -> data processing / logic

Psycopg2
create a new database 
create the tables -> products, sales, stock , users

create database db_name;
create database myduka_app;


insert into products(name,buying_price,selling_price)values('bread',50,60);
myduka2=# select * from products;
 id | name  | buying_price | selling_price 
----+-------+--------------+---------------
  1 | bread |        50.00 |         60.00
(1 row)


PSYCOPG2
-Goal -> write and execute sql queries in python
-perform CRUD operations on data in Python rather than an SQL env. 
C ->CREATE -> INSERT
R -> READ -> SELECT 
U -UPDATE -> UPDATE 
D -DELETE -> DELETE

PSYCOPG2 - a PostgreSQL database adapter for Python. Driver that connects your Python
code to a db

establishing  connection to the db 
psycopg2.connect()
1.user -> postgres -> postgres user
2.password -> password attached to that postgres user
3.host -> where is your db located? -> localhost (your pc)
            --localhost -> ip address of your device -> 127.0.0.1 
4.port -> where exactly on my device is the PostgreSQL service running?
5.database -> db you want to connect to e.g myduka_app

cur -> object to perform db operations

Take note of data structure format - what is the data stored in?

[(1, 'bread', Decimal('50.00'), Decimal('60.00'))] -> 
list of one tuple -> for one product
list of tuples -> multiple products

[(1, 'bread', Decimal('50.00'), Decimal('60.00')), (2, 'milk', Decimal('40.00'), Decimal('60.00')), (3, 'milk', Decimal('40.00'), Decimal('60.00')), (4, 'milk', Decimal('40.00'), Decimal('60.00')), (5, 'milk', Decimal('40.00'), Decimal('60.00'))]

Functions -> block of reusable code -> used with return keyword

1. Reusability - parameters
2. Organization -readability
3. Easy debugging
4. Modularity -> breaks code into smaller reusable chunks

            variable scopes
local variable -> accessible in its defined block
global variable -> accessible in the entire program

TASK 
1. insert one sale using sql shell / psql in your sales table
2. fetch that sale using psycopg2 and print it in your terminal -> use a fetch_sale()
        ->take note of data format
3.insert another 3 sales using psycopg2 and use fetch sales function to see your inserted data
 -> for 2 & 3 -> use functions


 html/css/js <--------> python <-----------> sql
constraints -> Unique 
    "insert into products(name,buying_price,selling_price)values('eggs',15,20)"

parameter -> placeholder / temporary value passed when defining  function
arguments (args) -> actual values passed when calling the function

1. a function that gets data from any table
2. insert products with parameters
3. insert sales with parameters


insert into products(name,buying_price,selling_price)values(values)

FLASK
Is a Python framework used to build web applications 

Framework && Library


Framework is pre-built code that gives you a starting point to build applications faster
and easily -  comes with ready made tools and features so that you dont have to build everything
from scratch
Library - pre-wriiten that you can use to solve specific problems or add features to your program

Analogy -> Building a House
Scenrio 1
You could build a house yourself with no help at all using tools you want and how you want to use 
them -> flexibility -> no restrictions  -> LIBRARY
e.g 
Numpy ,Matplotlib, Pandas, tensorflow (ML) ,Scikit-Learn(ML)

Scenario 2
You enlist the help of building professionals who dictate how to build the house and in what
time frame including what tools should be used - You follow restrictions, guidelines as pointed
out by these professionals  -> FRAMEWORK -> follows strict framework guidelines
e.g Python -> Flask ,FastAPI,Django
    JS -> React, Vue, Angular, Svelte
    C#  -> .NET
    Java - Spring
    NODEJS -> Express


Routing Feature
Routing : mechanism to map URLS to Python functions - system for resource navigtion 
Routing connects a URL to a function in your flask app

Home -----> (functions) ------>About Us
/                              /about_us

https://techcamp.co.ke   -- Home
https://techcamp.co.ke/about_us   -- About Us
https://techcamp.co.ke/certifications - Certification Trainings
URL _> full address used to access resources online
Route -> part of the URL that determines what function to execute when a 
specific url is called

-> In Flask routes are defined using a decorator function -> @app.route() -> @
Decorator is a function that determines the behaviour of another function

View function -> the actual function executing to provide resources

www.google.com -> 198.168.0.1

127.0.0.1 -> localhost -> your local device
http://127.0.0.1:5000
5000 -> port -> where exactly on localhost is this flask server running

http://127.0.0.1:5000/
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
https://www.safaricom.co.ke/mpesa

A    =-------=    B

How Routing Works
1. User enters a URL and Flask matches the URL to a registered route
2. If route is found -> view function executes and data is returned
3. If not found -> returns 404 


->static 
  -> represents all static files -> css,js,images,videos,favicons
->templates
  -> defines where to put all html files
  -> a single html file is called a template
-database.py 
-main.py 


N/B ---- cant have 2 view functions with same name


-index.html
-products.html
-sales.html
-stock.html
-dashboard.html


Get data from db
      |
Get to Flask
       |
Display data in html (tables)


Returning A HTML FILE
1.place the file inside templates folder
2.import a function from Flask responsible for returning html files
3.pass the name of the html file as an argument to this function


JINJA
- a templating engine integrated with flask to render dynamic html pages
- we can use Jinja to pass Python data and logic in html  
1.Jinja with data
---> {{ }} -> variables
---> {% %} -logic -> control structures
1. initialize logic
2. logic definition
3. terminate logic


Control Structures
1.Sequence - execute a program top to bottom left to right
2.Iteration - looping e.g for loops, while , do while
3.Selection - conditional statements -if -> decision makers
 e.g






Meanwhile get a navbar from bootstrap ---have the following in the navbar
 Home ---- Products ----Sales ---- Stock --- Dashboard


 1.Create a parent template that houses all common elements 
 e.g navbar, footer
 2. Have all the other pages inherit from the parent template

Define content inside blocks



html
    {% block title %} {% endblock %}
  body

    div
        div Navbar div

        {% block content %} {% endblock %}


        div Footer div
    div
  body
html

    TASK:
Display sales data in a sales table within sales page -> use template inheritance to provide 
navbar and footer to the sales page from base

Psycopg2
Routing - decorator func, view func , route/path
Displayed data with Flask
Template Inheritance

POSTING DATA WITH FLASK
Posting - sending data to a server e.g login , sending money etc

Process
1.Provide the user with a form to fill some data - Bootstrap
2.User fills form and submits data
3.Form is submitted to a route in Flask 
4.If route is found data is processed and posted to the db using functions
5.Data is viewed - redirect a user back to the products page


Form Checklist
-> method attribute  - in the opening form tag
-> action attribute - in the opening form tag
-> name attribute - key used by the server to access values from data
-> input type
-> button type submit


method -> telling a server what to do with data 
    types of methods: ->
    GET - fetching or getting data from a server e.g fetching products
    POST - sending data to a server e.g adding products,making sales
    PUT - Updating existing data e.g updating selling price
    DELETE - getting rid of data 

action -> where do you want data from the form to be processed -> route


N/B 
Get - list of tuples
Post - from the form ,data comes in form of key-value pairs x:y e.g 
    'product':'eggs'


Extracting data from a form
1.methods
2.use request object from flask to extract form data using the key(name attribute)
  request.form -> extract data from a form using a key
  request.method -> tells a server what method is being used


redirect(url_for()) -> where to take a user after a specific action
  -is a function
  -pass as argument the name of the view function where you want to take them


Status Codes  - a way for theserver to communicate with an application
1 -> Informational
2-> succesful responses
3-> redirection
4 -> client error
5 -> server error


POSTING / MAKING SALES
id | pid | quantity |         created_at         
----+-----+----------+----------------------------
  1 |   1 |       12 | 2025-07-22 15:03:12.084641


Insert into sales(pid,quantity)values()


{{}} - variables
{% %} - control structures

Implement full add stock functionality using a form
Hint -> Posting stock is exactly the same as posting sales


eggs - 100

50
100 - 50 = 50
#stock
1 eggs 100 created_at
1 eggs 100 created_at
1 eggs 300 created_at


400 eggs


#sales
1 eggs 40 created_at
1 eggs 50 created_at
1 eggs 60 created_at

150 eggs

400 -150 = 250 eggs
Flash Messaging - used to send one time notifications from the server to the client
to notify a user about the result of an action
e.g action - adding a product
    notification - Product Added succesfully
                  - Could not add product
                
-Implemented using flash()
-Messages / notifications are usually stored in a session cookie
-secret-key

Message Categories
1.success - green
2.error/danger -red
3.info - blue
4.warning - yellow


Task - 1.Have the make sale and add stock forms inside a modal
      2.Add flashing for stock and sales route

DASHBOARD
In our dashboard -> simple data visualization
1. Query for data you're interested in .
2. Use some charts to display this data -> line charts -> bar charts 
-> pie charts -> frequency polygon -> scatter plots -> heatmaps 

-> Line chart -> data with a time component
-> Bar Chart -> categorical data (months,days,product names)
1. Sales -> sales per product - bar chart
        -> sales per day -line
2.Profit -> profit per product - bar
          -> profit per day - line 

select products.name ,sum(products.selling_price * sales.quantity) as total_sales from products inner join sales on sales.pid = products.id group by products.name;

select products.name , sum((products.selling_price -products.buying_price) * sales.quantity) from sales join products 
on sales.pid = products.id group by products.name;

select sales.created_at as date, sum(product.selling_price * sales.quantity) as total_sales from products inner join sales
on sales.pid = products.id group by(date);


select sales.created_at as date, sum((products.selling_price -products.buying_price) * sales.quantity) as profit from products inner join sales on sales.pid = products.id group by(date);




Sales per product  -product
Profit per product  -product
product -> x axis
sales & profit -> y axis


 
Sale per day - day
Profit per day  - day
day - x axis
sales & profit - y axis


eggs - sales - profit

phones - 100 - 
None vs 0


Registering a user -> posting data ->posting user's data
Posting Data Form CheckList
1.Method -> GET,POST,PUT,DELETE -> 
2.Action -> where do you want to send data
3.Name -> key 
4.Input Type -> 
5.Button type submit 


insert into users(full_name,email,phone_number,password)values()

Take user input using a form
Submit data to register route
Extract that user data using request.form
Check if that user exists -> double registration -use email to check
If user exists -> flash user exists and redirect to login
If user doesnt exist -> hash password and add user

Hashing Passwords -> changing human redable password texts to formats that cant be deciphered easily
1234 -> #hjrjiid9djby73u88eh3bv3bb
-converting plaain text password into unreadable strings -security

decode utf -8 process of converting bytes into text

utf -> Unicode Transformation Format
unicode -> universal representation of characters to represent text from any language


1234 - $299dbbc878wenndxhjhxjjjkcxkkdk

session -> a way to temporarily store user data across multiple requests on an application
